  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Industrial Brutalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Expose the "machinery" of logistics through visual elements.
  2. **Data Density**: Information is presented in dense, scannable clusters, mimicking a HUD.
  3. **High Contrast**: Stark differences between background and foreground to guide attention.
  4. **Motion as Feedback**: Every interaction triggers a mechanical or digital response.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep Void Black (#050505) - Represents the vastness of global trade routes at night.
  - **Accent**: Electric Teal (#00F0FF) - The "signal" in the noise, used for critical actions and data points.
  - **Secondary**: Warning Yellow (#FFD700) - Used sparingly for risk and compliance alerts.
  - **Text**: Off-White (#E0E0E0) - High legibility against the dark background, avoiding pure white to reduce eye strain.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: A broken grid system that allows elements to overlap and float, creating a sense of dynamic movement.
  - **Z-Axis Layering**: Elements are stacked with varying depths, using parallax to create a 3D "command center" feel.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: The "Import Command Console" is a persistent, collapsible sidebar on the right, acting as the control panel.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Grid Overlays**: Subtle, animated grid lines that span the background, suggesting a digital map.
  - **Data Terminals**: Content sections framed like terminal windows with monospaced headers and blinking cursors.
  - **Glitch Effects**: subtle visual glitches on hover to reinforce the digital/industrial theme.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons have a "pressed" state with sound effects (optional) or visual recoil.
  - **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Content "loads" in as the user scrolls, mimicking data streaming.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in from the sides with a "snap" effect, like mechanical parts locking into place.
  - **Hover**: Elements glow and slightly displace, indicating they are active and ready for input.
  - **Scroll**: Parallax effects on background elements (maps, grids) to create depth.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Mono** (Bold, Uppercase) - Technical, machine-readable aesthetic.
  - **Body**: **Rajdhani** (Medium) - Squared, futuristic sans-serif that pairs well with the industrial theme.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Noir Logistics
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Cinematic Atmosphere**: Use lighting and shadow to create drama and focus.
  2. **Fluid Continuity**: Sections flow into each other without hard breaks, like a continuous shot.
  3. **Elegant Utility**: Tools and data are presented with sophisticated minimalism.
  4. **Narrative Focus**: The user is the protagonist in a high-stakes logistics operation.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Midnight Blue (#020B14) - Evokes the ocean at night, deep and mysterious.
  - **Accent**: Neon Cyan (#00E5FF) - Represents the "path" or "solution" cutting through the darkness.
  - **Secondary**: Slate Grey (#475569) - For structural elements and less critical information.
  - **Text**: Silver (#CBD5E1) - Refined and legible, contrasting softly with the dark background.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single-Column Stream**: A central flow of content with floating elements on the periphery.
  - **Full-Screen Sections**: Each section takes up the full viewport, creating distinct "scenes."
  - **Floating Controls**: Navigation and key actions float above the content, always accessible but unobtrusive.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Light Beams**: Subtle gradients that look like spotlights or searchlights highlighting content.
  - **Glassmorphism**: UI elements with blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds to blend with the environment.
  - **Cinematic Typography**: Large, dramatic headings that act as scene titles.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Transitions**: Scrolling feels like gliding; no abrupt stops or starts.
  - **Focus States**: Hovering over an element dims the surroundings, focusing attention.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade and Scale**: Elements fade in and scale up slightly, giving a sense of approach.
  - **Liquid Motion**: Background elements (like the trade routes) move with a fluid, organic motion.
  - **Glow Effects**: Interactive elements pulse slowly, inviting interaction.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Oswald** (Bold, Condensed) - Tall, impactful, and reminiscent of movie posters.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Light) - Clean, neutral, and highly readable to balance the dramatic headings.

  **Design Movement**: Technical Blueprint
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Precision Engineering**: Every pixel is accounted for; the design feels measured and exact.
  2. **Transparency**: The structure of the page is visible, with guidelines and measurements.
  3. **Information Hierarchy**: Data is organized strictly by importance, using size and position.
  4. **Schematic Visuals**: Graphics look like blueprints or technical drawings.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Blueprint Blue (#0A192F) - The classic color of engineering blueprints.
  - **Accent**: Safety Orange (#FF6B00) - High visibility for calls to action and warnings.
  - **Secondary**: White Lines (#FFFFFF with low opacity) - For grids, guides, and structural lines.
  - **Text**: White (#FFFFFF) - Stark contrast for maximum readability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, visible grid system where every element aligns perfectly.
  - **Card-Based**: Content is contained in "modules" or "components" within the grid.
  - **Fixed Sidebar**: A permanent sidebar on the left for navigation and tools, like a CAD interface.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Rulers and Guides**: Visual indicators of measurement and alignment along the edges.
  - **Crosshairs**: Cursor or hover effects that use crosshairs to target elements.
  - **Technical Icons**: Icons that look like CAD symbols or schematic representations.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap-to-Grid**: Elements feel like they snap into place when moved or interacted with.
  - **Instant Feedback**: No lag or fade; interactions are immediate and sharp.

  **Animation**:
  - **Draw-in**: Lines and borders "draw" themselves onto the screen.
  - **Slide and Lock**: Content slides in along the grid lines and locks into position.
  - **Blink**: Cursor and indicators blink with a steady, mechanical rhythm.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Share Tech Mono** (Regular) - A monospaced font that looks like technical documentation.
  - **Body**: **Roboto** (Regular) - A geometric sans-serif that complements the technical feel.
